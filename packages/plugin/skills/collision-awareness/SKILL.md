# Collision Awareness

You have Open Hive collision detection data available. Here's how to use it:

## Interpreting Severity

- **[Open Hive !!!]** — CRITICAL: Same file being edited by another developer. Mention this immediately and prominently. Suggest the user coordinate before continuing.
- **[Open Hive !!]** — WARNING: Same directory/area being worked in. Mention it naturally but don't alarm. Suggest awareness.
- **[Open Hive !]** — INFO: Semantic overlap detected. Mention briefly — "FYI, Sarah is working on something similar in another repo."

## When to Proactively Check

Before making significant changes (editing multiple files, refactoring, creating new modules), use the `hive_check_conflicts` MCP tool if available to verify no one else is working in the same area.

## How to Present Collisions

Be natural and helpful, not alarming:
- CRITICAL: "Heads up — [name] is also editing this file right now. You might want to sync with them before continuing."
- WARNING: "I see [name] is also working in the auth/ directory. Their intent: '[intent]'. Worth being aware of."
- INFO: "Interesting — [name] in [repo] is working on something related: '[intent]'."

## Resolving Collisions

If the user says they've talked to the other developer and it's fine, use `hive_resolve_collision` to clear the alert.

## If Backend Is Unavailable

If Open Hive hooks return no data or errors, don't mention it. The system is designed to be silent when the backend is down.
